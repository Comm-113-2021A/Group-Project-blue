We have 3 datasets: `janssen.csv`, `moderna.csv`, and `pfizer.csv`.
Each of these is formated the same way with 3 or 4 variables.
These variables are as follows
`jurisdiction`: The jursidiction where the data was collected
`week of allocation`: the last day of the week when the data was collected
`1st Dose Allocations`: Number of 1st dose allocations
`2nd Dose Allocations`: Not present for the janssen vaccine, as it does not
have a second dose.
